# Portfolio Website

Created a website using Github Pages and Jekyll. I used the Minimal theme because of its simplicity. You can check out the template [here](https://github.com/asaxena2019/minimal-particle-template). The live website can be found at [http://asaxena2019.github.io/](http://asaxena2019.github.io/).
